## NMIS GitHub
Welcome to the NMIS GitHub organisation!

Please read this guide before creating repositories, teams, projects or changing aspects of the site.

### NMIS GitHub Teams
The NMIS GitHub organisation has been setup to reflect the organisation structure of NMIS. GitHub uses the terms "Teams" for any grouping of people - you can have teams within teams within teams. At the highest level we have the following major teams that align with functional groups:

- [Advanced Forming Research Centre](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/advanced-forming-research-centre)
- [Digital Factory](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/digital-factory)
- [Digital Process Manufacturing Centre](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/digital-process-manufacturing-centre)
- [Lightweight Manufacturing Centre](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/lightweight-manufacturing-centre)
- [Manufacturing Skills Academy](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/manufacturing-skills-academy)

Each functional group can be organised into smaller teams if they desire.

### Repository Naming Conventions
Code repositories (repos) may be created for projects or may be used for ongoing capability development. Repos may be public or private:

- Public - Accessible to the entire internet.
- Private - Accessible to designated groups/individuals or external collaborators within the NMIS Group Github organisation.
