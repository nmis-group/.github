## NMIS GitHub
Welcome to the NMIS GitHub organisation!

Please read this guide before creating repositories, teams, projects or changing aspects of the site.

### NMIS GitHub Teams
The NMIS GitHub organisation has been setup to reflect the organisational structure of NMIS. GitHub uses the terms "Teams" for any grouping of people - you can have teams within teams within teams. At the highest level we have the following major teams that align with research centres or directorates:

- [Advanced Forming Research Centre](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/advanced-forming-research-centre)
- [Data-driven Manufacturing](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/data-driven-manufacturing)
- [Digital Factory](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/digital-factory)
- [Digital Process Manufacturing Centre](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/digital-process-manufacturing-centre)
- [Lightweight Manufacturing Centre](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/lightweight-manufacturing-centre)
- [Manufacturing Skills Academy](https://github.com/orgs/nmis-group/teams/manufacturing-skills-academy)

Each functional group can be organised into smaller teams if they desire.

### Code Repositories
Code repositories (repos) may be created for projects or may be used for ongoing capability development. Repos may be public or private:

- Public - Accessible to the entire internet. Nothing IP sensitive should be part of a pubic repo.
- Private - Accessible to designated groups/individuals or external collaborators within the NMIS Group Github organisation.

Please note, since the GitHUb servers are located in the US by default, nothing that would compromise export control, internal NMIS rules or external partner rules should be part of a repo (public or private(. GitHub Enterprise can be purchased to define cloud tenancy within the UK if this becomes an ongoing requirement. Any code that has IP sensitivities should be discussed with your IP champion and if there is any doubt, store code offline on NMIS/University of Strathclyde servers.

For repo naming, please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/nmis-group/.github/blob/main/guide--repo-naming-conventions.md).
