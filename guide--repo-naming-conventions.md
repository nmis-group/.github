## Repository Naming Conventions
To improve search functionality and uniformity, NMIS repositories should abide by the following naming conventions:
- Lower case characters
- Words seperated by dashes (-) - not spaces or underscores


### Project Repos
If the repository is for a project, please use the project name as a reference. For example project named:

    DIGF-CATP-06092 - Digital Environment for Manufacturing Operations - DEMO
    
Would have repository name:

    digf-catp-06092-digital-environment-for-manufacturing-operations-demo
    
### Non-project Repos
There will be many cases of non-project repositories - code development for continuous improvement, centre operations, staff projects and other engagements. In these cases, users should create repos with the following format:

    centre-repo-focus

For example, a repo for developing ziglang for connectivity applications by a Digital Factory team member would be:

    digf-zig-development-comms-broker
